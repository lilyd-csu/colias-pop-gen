### Background
I have data from 165 clouded sulfur butterflies (Colias philodice eriphyle) from paired high- and low-elevation sites, both east and west of the continental divide, around Colorado and southern Wyoming (15 sites total; see attached map). In the field, I took GPS points for every collected individual and collected weather data (temperature and wind speed). I sequenced the individuals using three lanes HiSeq, which yielded an average coverage of around 5x with a fair amount of variation, so I down sampled to 4X. I processed the data using both genotype likelihoods using ANGSD and called genotypes with GATK, which both yielded similar population structure using PCA. So, I will proceed with my filtered and merged VCF file for future analyses.
